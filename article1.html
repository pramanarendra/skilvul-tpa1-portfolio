            <p>In web development, cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to style HTML. You can write vanilla CSS, use a
                CSS framework, use a preprocessor like Sass, or use a combination of all three to style your webpage.
                There are many different ways to use CSS and many tools to pick from. You might have heard of Bootstrap
                or Tailwind CSS being mentioned here and there while looking for a framework or tool to use in your
                project. They’re both CSS frameworks that can help speed up production time — but between these two,
                which one should you use?</p>
            <p>Bootstrap has UI components baked into it, so all you have to do is add your content and flavor to it.
                Bootstrap’s utility and layout classes provide you with everything you need to style a responsive
                webpage. With Tailwind, however, you are much more involved in styling the webpage because you end up
                having to create your own components using the utility classes that the framework offers.</p>
